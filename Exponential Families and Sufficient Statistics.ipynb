    "## Exposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Sufficient statistics are an intuitive way of reducing the data down to what is necessary for computation. For an unrealistic example, say we have amassed $1e10$ data points and know the data follows a normal distribution, then we do not need to store the $1e^10$ points, but rather we could compute the sample mean and standard deviation only. Thus sufficiency is primarily a tool akin to filtering and dimension reduction for reducing our data to what is necessary for a particular distribution. **Notice** however, that sufficiency requires us to **know beforehand the underlying distribution**. For this reason, sufficiency is primarly of interest to wacky theoretical statiscians and not scientists in practice who enjoy non-parametric inference....\n",

Further, let $T$ be a statistic such that the distribution of $T$ only depends on $\\phi$, a function of $\\theta$. Then $T$ is said to be **inference sufficient** for $\\phi$ if the conditional distribution of $X$ given $T$ depends only on functions of $\\theta$ which are independent of $\\phi$. Let $X_1,\\dots, X_n$ be $n$ independent observations from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$. Show that $\\sum (X_i-\\bar{X})^2$ is inference sufficient for the parameter $\\sigma^2$.\n",
