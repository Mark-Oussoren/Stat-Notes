# Stat-Notes

- To install jupyter notebooks: ```pip install jupyter``` or ```pip3 install jupyter```.
- To add R to Jupyter notebooks: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44056164/jupyter-client-has-to-be-installed-but-jupyter-kernelspec-version-exited-wit.

## Overview
The repository is intended to serve as a collection of notes on statistical and mathematical concepts for later use on the job or in your own research. I personally think notes should follow the following structure:

  1) Exposition - this should start off with a very simple explanation of the topic (intuitive easy examples an 8th grader could maybe pick up), followed by more in depth rigor and definitions. After the broad description is given, the topic should have the key definitions, theorems, and technical details and assumptions explained in manual like format or reference to texts/pages that do so.  
  2) Examples/Problems - this section should have a class of examples and or problems with solutions to give the reader enough to work on their own. The real learning really takes place with personal struggle with problems - think like an intro to analysis class.
  3) Code (optional) - this section isn't necessary, but it really catalyzes the learning process to code out the algorithms and models in Python, R, or C. This section could also serve to provide some nice visuals - say graphing simulations, model forecasts, etc. 
  4) Sources - this is really the most important. I don't expect us to explain subjects better than material already in existence - if you find great references for certain topics (i.e. Feller for probability or Rudin for analysis) - then including a link is very helpful for relearning the material.
  
## Status of Notebooks

Notebooks in WIP are not finished - i.e. these are missing thorough exposition, lucid examples, and problems to work through. There are several notebooks that are not subsets of statistics but rather pillars from other areas of STEM - primarily mathematics that form a basis for topics in modern statistics. Some notebooks in WIP may not be finished due to me losing interest in the topic/time drain - time-series is one example where current literature is lackluster and I do not buy into its
forecasting capabilities to be honest.
