# Stat-Notes

## Overview
The repository is intended to serve as a collection of notes on fundamental statistical and mathematical concepts for later use in applications/the job or teaching. I personally think notes should follow the following structure:\
  1) Exposition - this should start off with a very simple explanation of the topic (intuitive easy examples an 8th grader could maybe pick up), followed by more in depth rigor and definitions. After the broad description is given, the topic should have the key definitions, theorems, and technical details and assumptions explained in manuel like format or reference to texts/pages that do so.  
  2) Examples/Problems - this section should have a class of examples and or problems with solutions to give the reader enough to work on their own. The real learning really takes place with personal struggle with problems - think like an intro to analysis class.
  3) Code (optional) - this section isn't necessary, but if you want to really learn algorithms and models - adding your own implementation in base R or Python or C really helps with understanding what's going on. This section could also serve to provide some nice visuals - say graphing the law of large numbers, simulating monte carlo, etc. 
  4) Sources - this is really the most important. I don't expect us to be able to explain many subjects better than those already in existence, but if you find great references for certain topics - i.e. Feller for probability or Rudin for analysis, then this would help down the line on the job or for our own benefit learn the topic more thoroughly.
