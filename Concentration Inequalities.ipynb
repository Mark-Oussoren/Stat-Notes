    "I believe the layout of this notebook will be as follows: 1) I will first provide the inequalities, definitions, theorems and main results in Markdown - just the basics and sentences explaining them in english coupled with worked out solutions to the book problems of \"Concentration Inequalities\" by Boucheron et al.\n",
