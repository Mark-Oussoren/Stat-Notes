    "## 2 - Vectors and Matrices\n",
    "### 3. Vector Addition\n",
    "1. Show that we have commutativity, $x+y=y+x$, and associativity, $x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I assume our matrices are either integer, rational, real, or complex. In any of these cases, it trivially follows that since $x+y=y+x$ for $x,y\\in\\mathcal{F}$ that the same holds if we perform the addition elementwise as done in vector addition. On a similar note, we know these fields of numbers are associative, so associativity is also an inherent condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define subtraction of two vectors directly, and in terms of addition; that is, $x-y$ is a vector $z$ such that $y+z=x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $z=x+(-y)$, so $y+(x+(-y))=x+(y+(-y))=x$ by associativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "1. Show that $(c_1+c_2)(x+y)=c_1x+c_1y+c_2x+c_2y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(c_1+c_2)(x+y)=(c_1+c_2)x+(c_1+c_2)y=c_1x+c_2x+c_1y+c_2y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the null vector, written 0, to be the vector all of whose components are zero. Show that it is uniquely determined as the vector 0 for which $x+0=x$ for all $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Again, this question stems from our understanding of the field of numbers we are working with. Clearly $x+0=x$ for $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and this concept extends for each entry as we denote the zero vector by $n$ zeros in a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The Inner Product of Two Vectors\n",
    "1. If $x$ is real, show that $(x,x)>0$ unless $x$ is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $x\\neq 0$, $(x,x)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^2>0$ for some component $x_i\\neq 0$ in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Show that $(ux+vy,ux+vy)=u^2(x,x)+2uv(x,y)+v^2(y,y)$ is a non-negative definite quadratic form in the scalar variables $u$ and $v$ if $x$ and $y$ are real and hence that \n",
    "$$(x,y)^2\\leq (x,x)(y,y)$$\n",
    "for any two real vectors $x$ and $y$ (Cauchy's inequality).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(ux+vy,ux+vy)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (ux_i+vy_i)^2$. This quantity is clearly non-negative provided the field of numbers is real or rational. To show Cauchy's inequality, we know $(ux+vy)(ux+vy)=u^2(x,x)+2uv(x,y)+v^2(y,y)$ by expanding out the inner product. If we consider $u=-\\sqrt{(y,y)}$ and $v=\\sqrt{(x,x)}$, then the above becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(-\\sqrt{y,y}\\right)^2(x,x)-2\\sqrt{(y,y)(x,x)}(x,y)+\\left(\\sqrt{x,x}\\right)^2(y,y)\\geq 0\\iff 2(x,x)(y,y)\\geq 2\\sqrt{(y,y)(x,x)}(x,y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\iff (x,x)^2(y,y)^2\\geq (x,x)(y,y)(x,y)^2\\iff (x,x)(y,y)\\geq (x,y)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the geometric interpretation of this result?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The projection of a vector onto another does not have longer length than the vector itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using this result, show that for real vectors $x$ and $y$ that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(x+y,x+y)^{1/2}\\leq (x,x)^{1/2}(y,y)^{1/2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Cauchy's, $(x+y,x+y)=(x,x)+2(x,y)+(y,y)\\leq(x,x)+2\\sqrt{(x,x)(y,y)}+(y,y)=\\left((x,x)^{\\frac{1}{2}}+(y,y)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^2$. From here, we simply take the square root of both sides and call it a day. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why is this inequality called the \"triangle inequality\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we have that a triangle's smallest two sides summed is greater than or equal to the hypotenuse - hence the name stemming from this geometric shape. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Let $A$ be a matrix with the property that $a_{ij}=0$ if $j\\neq i$, a diagonal matrix, and let $B$ be a matrix of similar type. Show that $AB$ is again a diagonal matrix, and that $AB=BA$.\n",

    "- Let $C=AB$. $c_{ij}=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}=a_{ik}b_{kj}=a_{ii}b_{ii}\\iff i=j$ otherwise the sum is zero. Thus the matrix is diagonal. Similarly, letting $D=BA$ we obtain $d_{ij}=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n b_{ij}a_{jk}=b_{ik}a_{kj}=b_{ii}a_{ii}\\iff i=j$ otherwise the sum is zero. As The field is commutative, interchanging these elements is allowed and so $C=D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let $A$ be a matrix with the property that $a_{ij}=0$, $j>i$, a triangular or semi-diagonal matrix, and let $B$ be a matrix of similar type. Show that $AB$ is again a triangular matrix, but that $AB\\neq BA$ in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $C=AB$ so $c_{ij}=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}=0$ if $k>i$ or $j>k$ which is equivalent to saying $j>i$ which implies the matrix is triangular. If $A=\\begin{bmatrix}a&0\\\\b&c\\end{bmatrix}$ and $B=\\begin{bmatrix}x&0\\\\y&z\\end{bmatrix}$, $AB\\neq BA$ if we ensure $bx+cy\\neq ay+bz$.\n",
